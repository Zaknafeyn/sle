System of linear equations

Technical task

Solve the system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination (also known as row reduction) with the general element.
Calculate the X vector and vector of errors (E = B-A*X):

1*x2 + 3*x3 + 2*x4 = -1;

1000*x1 + 3*x2 + x3 - 5*x4 = -2;

-3*x1 + 4*x2 + x3 + 4*x4 = -1;

4*x1 - 2*x3 - 3*x4 = 4.

The program should contain:
1. Displaying the input data (via tables that user allows to modify);
2. Displaying the intermediate solutions;
3. Displaying the X and E vectors;
3. Unit tests for happy and unhappy paths.
 
Additional:
- Result should be reachable via URL (hosted on GitHub pages, deployed to Heroku/Nodejitsu/DigitalOcean, your own private server etc.;
- Source code should be published on your GitHub account and link should be provided to us via e-mail.
